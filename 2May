4.Response:what response body and type you should return

Note : For checking in postman you should enable mocking service configuring which on the right up

//public the designed one to exachange using publish
//1.0.0, v1 -> used while pulishing
//we can add raml file from design centre while creating the project by clicking one '+' symbol while creating the project
//choose exchange then add your account to it. then after adding search for the raml file that you have created i.e Ecommerce
//then add and finish
//now raml file is added to our project
//in lister path is like /api/*
//while running in postman in place of * we have to give resouce name that we have given in raml in design centre
//I have created a project 2may-mule-raml
//I have created another configure file and taken subflow inside that logger and transform msg is kept
//In ecommerce flow that we have created in get method in place of transform put reference and refer to subflow then run the code and 
//don't forget to give query params as we have given in raml file to take input
//in postman if we check we will get the output :>)

 //scheduler project
 //The Scheduler component enables you to trigger a flow when a time-based condition is met
 
 //In afternoon class explained about raml and processing of payload
 ////expalined about resourceType and Traits
